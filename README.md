The copy on the page provides an overview of the sport, before leading on to the core function of the site, using positive language throughout to encourage participation.

Sessions section

This section provides an overview of the location, match types, timings and durations of the sessions.

Footer section

This section includes links to the various Play Football social media pages. They open in a new tab to allow easy navigation and ensure that the user doesn't lose their position on the site.
This is a valuable tool for the site as it allows users to view content, sign up and build interactions to facilitate growth for the site.

Benefits Page

The image of a crowd attending a match aims to highlight the popularity of the game and social elements. 

Benefits section

A selection of physical and mental benefits are outlined to summarise the vast benefits of participating in football. Brief descriptions are used to maintain attention and icons are used to break up the copy. On larger screens, the physical benefits go on one side and the mental on the other, emphasising how the sport is good for both.

An inspirational video has been added to the bottom of the page to demonstrate the emotional side of the sport. The use of music in the video is emotive and aims to further encourage participation.
